# Algorithm

本周选择的算法题是：[Maximum Difference Between Node and Ancestor](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-difference-between-node-and-ancestor/description/)。


## 规则

Given the `root` of a binary tree, find the maximum value `v` for which there exist **different** nodes `a` and `b` where `v = |a.val - b.val|` and `a` is an ancestor of `b`.

A node `a` is an ancestor of `b` if either: any child of `a` is equal to `b` or any child of `a` is an ancestor of `b`.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/09/tmp-tree.jpg)

```
Input: root = [8,3,10,1,6,null,14,null,null,4,7,13]
Output: 7
Explanation: We have various ancestor-node differences, some of which are given below :
|8 - 3| = 5
|3 - 7| = 4
|8 - 1| = 7
|10 - 13| = 3
Among all possible differences, the maximum value of 7 is obtained by |8 - 1| = 7.
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/09/tmp-tree-1.jpg)

```
Input: root = [1,null,2,null,0,3]
Output: 3
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 5000]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 105`

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def maxAncestorDiff(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        ans = [0]
        self.traverse(root, root.val, root.val, ans)
        return ans[0]
    
    def traverse(self, root, low, high, ans):
        if not root: return 0
        ans[0] = max(ans[0], abs(root.val-low), abs(root.val-high))
        self.traverse(root.left, min(low, root.val), max(high, root.val), ans)
        self.traverse(root.right, min(low, root.val), max(high, root.val), ans)
```
