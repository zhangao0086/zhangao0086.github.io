## Algorithm

本周选择的算法题是：[Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/)（买卖股票的最佳时机）

<!--more-->

规则如下：

Say you have an array `prices` for which the *i*th element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= prices.length <= 3 * 10 ^ 4`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 10 ^ 4`

### Solution

Runtime：60 ms，快过 78.99%。

Memory：15 MB，低于 78%。

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        profit = 0
        for i in range(1, len(prices)):
            diff = prices[i] - prices[i-1]
            if diff > 0: profit += diff
        return profit
```

[Let's Build dispatch_queue](https://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/friday-qa-2015-09-04-lets-build-dispatch_queue.html)

大神 Mike Ash 在文章里展示了如何构建一个轻量的 dispatch_queue，涉及到很多细节+思考点，值得一看。

[CommonJS 详细介绍](https://neveryu.github.io/2017/03/07/commonjs/)

CommonJS 模块特点：

- 所有代码都运行在模块作用域，不会污染全局作用域
- 独立性是模块的重要特点，模块内部最好不与程序的其他部分直接交互
- 模块可以多次加载，但是只会在第一次加载时运行一次，然后运行结果就被缓存了，以后再加载，就直接读取缓存结果，要想让模块再次运行，必须先清除缓存
- 模块加载的顺序，按照其在代码中出现的顺序
