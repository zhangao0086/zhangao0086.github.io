<ul>
	<li>init does not cause layoutSubviews to be called (duh)</li>
	<li>addSubview causes layoutSubviews to be called on the view being added, the view it&rsquo;s being added to (target view), and all the subviews of the target view</li>
	<li>setFrame intelligently calls layoutSubviews on the view having it&rsquo;s frame set only if the size parameter of the frame is different</li>
	<li>scrolling a UIScrollView causes layoutSubviews to be called on the scrollView, and it&rsquo;s superview</li>
	<li>rotating a device only calls layoutSubview on the parent view (the responding viewControllers primary view)</li>
	<li>removeFromSuperview &ndash; layoutSubviews is called on superview only (not show in table)</li>
</ul>
