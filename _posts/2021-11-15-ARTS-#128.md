# Algorithm

本周选择的算法题是：[Reducing Dishes](https://leetcode.com/problems/reducing-dishes/)。


## 规则

A chef has collected data on the `satisfaction` level of his `n` dishes. Chef can cook any dish in 1 unit of time.

**Like-time coefficient** of a dish is defined as the time taken to cook that dish including previous dishes multiplied by its satisfaction level i.e. `time[i] * satisfaction[i]`.

Return *the maximum sum of **like-time coefficient** that the chef can obtain after dishes preparation*.

Dishes can be prepared in **any** order and the chef can discard some dishes to get this maximum value.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: satisfaction = [-1,-8,0,5,-9]
Output: 14
Explanation: After Removing the second and last dish, the maximum total like-time coefficient will be equal to (-1*1 + 0*2 + 5*3 = 14).
Each dish is prepared in one unit of time.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: satisfaction = [4,3,2]
Output: 20
Explanation: Dishes can be prepared in any order, (2*1 + 3*2 + 4*3 = 20)
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: satisfaction = [-1,-4,-5]
Output: 0
Explanation: People don't like the dishes. No dish is prepared.
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: satisfaction = [-2,5,-1,0,3,-3]
Output: 35
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == satisfaction.length`
- `1 <= n <= 500`
- `-1000 <= satisfaction[i] <= 1000`

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def maxSatisfaction(self, satisfaction: List[int]) -> int:
        satisfaction.sort()
        ans, curr = 0, 0
        while satisfaction and satisfaction[-1] + curr > 0:
            curr += satisfaction.pop()
            ans += curr
        
        return ans
```

[Clean Architecture for Enterprise Flutter Application](https://geekysingh.medium.com/clean-architecture-for-enterprise-flutter-application-dc254a71059)

Clean Architecture 的侧重点在于代码的组织，其关注业务逻辑封装的同时，也看重交付机制的分离。从依赖方向上看，只有外层才能依赖内层，内层代码不知道外层的功能，如图：

作者在文中不仅给出了 Clean Architecture 的定义，还给出并描述了完整的细节，如目录结构概览、目录的职责与作用、数据通信的范本等，是不错的 Clean Architecture 入门参考。
